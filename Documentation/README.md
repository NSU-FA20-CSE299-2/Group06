## Changes in initial features  

- Nearby Connections API not acting expectedly, Reaching nearby users and all its corresponding features is put to hold for the time being.

- Emergency contacts need to be added by either phone number or username(first part of signup email) separately. Because phone number verification is not done in the app, phone number provided at the signup will only be used in sending the distress SMS.
